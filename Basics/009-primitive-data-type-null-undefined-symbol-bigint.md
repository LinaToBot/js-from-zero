# Bigint

BigInt is a data type introduced in JavaScript to allow the representation and
manipulation of large integers, that is, integers larger than the maximum limit
that the Number data type can handle.

The maximum limit for accurately representing integers in JavaScript
is Â±9,007,199,254,740,991. This is because JavaScript uses the IEEE 754 double-precision floating-point standard to represent numbers, which means that the integers that
can be represented precisely are limited by the capabilities of this standard. However,
with the introduction of BigInt in JavaScript, it is now possible to represent much larger
integers without losing precision.
