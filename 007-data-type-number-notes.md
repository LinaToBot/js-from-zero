## JAVASCRIPT AND ITS INACCURACY OF FLOATING POINT CALCULATIONS

JavaScript, like many programming languages, uses a standard
called IEEE 754 to represent floating point numbers, which can
sometimes lead to unexpected results in calculations. This is due to the
way floating point numbers are stored and manipulated internally in the computer.

The IEEE 754 standard has certain limitations in the representation of
decimal numbers in binary, which can cause inaccuracies in certain arithmetic
operations. Some decimal numbers cannot be represented exactly in binary, leading
to rounding errors when performing calculations with them. For example, 0.1 in base 10 has a periodic decimal representation in binary, which leads to a finite approximation
and therefore rounding errors in operations. ㅤ

This can result in situations where seemingly simple
operations, such as addition or subtraction, can result in unexpected values
due to these inaccuracies in the representation of numbers. ㅤ

There are strategies to mitigate this problem, such as: ㅤ

### 1. Rounding:

toFixed(): This method in JavaScript allows you to specify the number of decimal
places you want to keep in a number. For example: number.toFixed(2) will round
the number to two decimal places.

#### Math.round(), Math.floor(), Math.ceil():

These functions allow numbers to be rounded.

Math.round() rounds to the nearest integer
Math.floor() rounds down
Math.ceil() rounds up. ㅤ

### 2. Use of more precise mathematical libraries:

#### BigDecimal.js

It is a library that allows you to work with decimal numbers with arbitrary
precision in JavaScript, avoiding the rounding problems inherent to floating
point numbers.

#### math.js

This library provides a wide range of mathematical functions and expression
handling with improved precision.

#### BigInt:

If you're working with large integers, JavaScript now has support for BigInt,
which handles larger integers more precisely than standard numbers. ㅤ

### 3. Using integer operations when possible:

Instead of performing calculations with floating point numbers, if possible,
you can work with integers. This eliminates the precision problems associated
with decimal numbers. ㅤ

### 4. Knowledge and error handling:

Understanding how floating-point numbers work and how they behave in arithmetic
operations can help you anticipate and handle precision errors when they arise.

These strategies do not completely eliminate the precision limitations inherent
in floating point numbers, but they can help mitigate problems in certain
situations and improve the accuracy of calculations. The important thing is
to keep this inherent nature of calculations with floating point numbers in
mind when programming in JavaScript or any other language that uses this standard.
